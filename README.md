## What is this

This is a manual wrapper for `gtk3` for V.
The advantage compared to using `C.<function>` directly is that `vgtk3` uses V structs and does it best to have a good V style when "translating" `gtk3` to V.
This is mostly why the functions aren't auto-generated, as this doesn't create any helpful structures nor does it splits the files, because it doesn't know what a container is, this wrapper knows it and offers a `Container` interface ready for use.

> Notes: We are still combining everything together here, will be separated after everything is finished
